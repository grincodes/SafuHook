### Safu Hook: Decentralized Insurance for LPs

**Overview**
Safu Hook is a cutting-edge decentralized insurance solution designed to protect liquidity providers (LPs) from rug pulls and malicious activities. Integrated with **Uniswap V4** and **EigenLayer AVS**, it provides an on-chain safety net, ensuring LPs can recover a portion of their losses in case of detected exploits.

By leveraging **K3 Labs** for off-chain monitoring, Safu Hook flags suspicious swap transactions and increases transaction fees in pools identified as compromised. The insurance pool is funded by contributions from pool creators, LP providers, and swap fees, ensuring continuous liquidity protection.
