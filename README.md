### Safu Hook
Safu Hook is designed to give Lp Providers insurance against rug pools.
It uses  a decentralized insurance pool mechanism integrated with Uniswap V4 and Eigen AVS  to protect liquidity providers (LPs) from rug pulls and other malicious activities. 

The hook is integrated with K3 labs to do offchain monitoring on every swap event to determine if 
swap trnasactions are pottential rug transactions.
Once there is a suspected rug transaction detected on a pool , the pool is flaged as compromised
and transactions fee for each swap increases.

The insurance pool is funded through contributions from pool creators, LP providers, and swap fees, ensuring a safety net for LPs in case of detected exploits or rug pulls.

Once a pool is compromised LP holders can withdraw shares from the insurance pool to cover a small percentage of thier loos.

**Key Features:**


1. **LP Provider Contributions:**
   - Whenever a new LP provider adds liquidity to a pool, a minor fee is deducted from their deposit and contributed to the insurance pool.
   - This ensures that all participants in the pool contribute to the collective safety net.

2 **Swap Fee Allocation:**
   - A portion of the swap fees generated by the pool is redirected to the insurance pool.
   - This creates a sustainable and growing source of funding for the insurance mechanism.

3. **Rug Pull Detection & Claims:**
   - Integrate with AVS Hook to monitor and detect rug pulls or suspicious activities in real-time.
   - If a rug pull is detected, affected LP providers can claim compensation from the insurance pool.
   - Compensation is proportional to the amount of LP tokens held by each provider, ensuring fair distribution of funds.

4. **Transparent & Decentralized Management:**
   - The insurance pool is managed through a decentralized governance mechanism, allowing LPs to vote on key parameters such as contribution rates, fee allocations, and claim approvals.
   - Smart contracts ensure transparency and automate the distribution of funds during claims.
